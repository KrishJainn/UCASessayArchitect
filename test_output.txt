2020 market crash. My dad lost money. This prompted me. Why did markets fail like that? I looked for clear answers. The theories did not explain it fully. The standard explanations felt insufficient. There was a difference between textbook logic and real-world losses. I wanted to address this difference.

I read Daniel Kahneman's 'Thinking Fast and Slow.' He presented economic actors as largely rational. They weighed options, made logical choices. My experience watching the market crash did not fit this. People panic. Decisions are often quick, driven by fear. This is not rational. I read Stiglitz on market failure. He detailed how markets do not self-correct perfectly. Externalities, information asymmetry. These create failures. Not just individual irrationality. But systemic issues. I explored cryptocurrency regulation for my Extended Project Qualification. Cryptocurrencies are volatile. They operate with minimal traditional oversight. Rules are not fixed. My EPQ examined how regulation tries to stabilize these markets. It looked at attempts to protect investors. It questioned if traditional economic models fully explain this new asset class. My A-levels, Maths A*, Economics A*, Further Maths A, gave me a foundation. Maths taught logic. Economics provided frameworks to analyze markets. Further Maths developed my problem-solving skills for complex models. I used these subjects to question established ideas. To find my own positions.

I built a Python trading bot. It backtested various market strategies. It showed direct links between data and outcomes. This helped me see models in practice. I led my school's debate team. We debated current economic policies. We prepared arguments for different sides. Our team won the regional finals. I work part-time at an accountancy firm. I deal with tax forms, financial statements. I see real tax burdens. I observe how inflation impacts small business cash flow. My parents own small businesses. I grew up watching them navigate changing tax policies, rising costs. Economics became personal, not abstract. I wrote articles for the school economics journal. I attended the LSE summer school to deepen my knowledge. I also volunteer as a tutor for younger students in maths and economics.
