Man where do I even begin. I guess 2020 really got me thinking. You know the whole economy just went… sideways. One day things are okay, the next it’s just crashing, global pandemic and all that, and honestly it messed with my head. I was watching the news, seeing my parents stress about their small business losing sales, and just kept asking like, why? What even happened here? That’s what started me really. I mean yeah markets, but *how*? That’s why I picked up Kahneman actually, *Thinking Fast and Slow*. And wow, it just kind of clicked. All this talk about rational actors in economic theory – it felt wrong. It felt, like, super detached from what I was seeing and experiencing. People don't always make logical choices. They just don't. And I wanted to argue with it, pretty much the whole way through the book. Because if people are illogical, if there are all these biases, then the economy isn’t some perfect, self-correcting machine. No, it’s not. It’s chaotic, actually no it’s messy and that’s a big part of why it's so interesting to me. Understanding that chaos, trying to find some sort of pattern in it, even if it's just a pattern of irrationality, that's what draws me in. This isn't just theory for me. It feels personal because of what my family went through, you know.

So that led me to start trying things out myself. Reading isn’t enough. I tried building this small trading bot in Python during lockdown, just scraping real-time data from financial sites and seeing if I could predict *anything*. It was… complicated. A lot of late nights staring at code that just *wouldn't work* the way I thought it should. But what it really hammered home was how many unexpected factors affect prices. And just how emotional people are, how it gets reflected in thier decisions. Seeing my code fail repeatedly was a good lesson in humility I guess. But I kept trying. And building something like that from scratch felt empowering, knowing I could apply a theoretical model and see it tested. And that kind of analytical thinking, figuring out logical paths, really helped me as debate captain too. Winning regionals wasn't just about sounding smart, it was about anticipating how people think, understanding underlying motives even when they're hidden, and arguing for something totally different to what I believed if needed. That whole process just trains you to deconstruct arguments, identify weaknesses, and think really quickly under pressure. Which is pretty similar to reacting to market news, honestly. It's about seeing the bigger picture but also picking apart the tiny details.

Then working part-time at this accountancy firm, it wasn’t always thrilling – lots of spreadsheets, sure – but it showed me the absolute bedrock of how businesses operate. Not the big banks, but the small local places, the ones my parents run too. Seeing how cash flow actually works for them, the direct impact of taxes, or the difficulty of finding good credit. And yeah, it’s not flashy, but it’s real economics. The kind of day-to-day stuff that influences bigger trends and maybe explains why companies take certain risks or avoid them. And seeing that connection, from theoretical biases in Kahneman, to my dodgy Python bot, to a real company’s balance sheet just makes me want to dive even deeper. So applying to Oxford for Economics? I want to grapple with these massive ideas, the theories that try to explain human behaviour and market failures but with tutors who will challenge every assumption. I want to argue it out in tutorials, poke holes in ideas, maybe even come up with some of my own that make sense of what I’ve seen, the chaos. I really believe I can contribute to that kind of environment. And learning how to genuinely understand this incredibly complex system, that’s just super exciting.
